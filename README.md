## Objectives:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. Study and understand the Structural Design Patterns.__

&ensp; &ensp; __2. As a continuation of the previous laboratory work, think about the functionalities that your system will need to provide to the user.__

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Implement some additional functionalities, or create a new project using structural design patterns.__


## Main tasks:
&ensp; &ensp; __1. By creating a new project, or extending your last one (Lab work Nr2), implement at least 2 structural design patterns in your project:__
* The implemented design pattern should help to perform the tasks involved in your system.
* The object creation mechanisms/patterns can now be buried into the functionalities instead of using them into the client.
* There should only be one client for the whole system.

&ensp; &ensp; __2. Keep your files grouped (into packages/directories) by their responsibilities (an example project structure):__
* client
* domain
    * factories
    * builder
    * models
* utilities
* data(if applies)

&ensp; &ensp; __3. Document your work in a separate markdown file according to the requirements presented below (the structure can be extended of course):__
* Topic of the laboratory work
* Author
* Introduction/Theory/Motivation
* Implementation & Explanation (you can include code snippets as well)
    * Indicate the location of the code snippet
    * Emphasize the main idea and motivate the usage of the pattern
* Results/Screenshots/Conclusions
